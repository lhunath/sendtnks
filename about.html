        <p>
            As the internet becomes ever vaster, grows ever bigger and gains in popularity, it is becoming a major
            platform for people to find each other in search of help and assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where before we might as the local hair dresser about what shampoo to use, the local mechanic about
            alternative fuel or the baker about the right amount of rising agent for your cookies; today we often
            prefer to turn to the infinite Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            But people are still people, whether they communicate in-person, over the phone or via an international
            computer network.<br />
            <strong>We still prefer to deal with a person rather than a manual</strong>.
            We still love sharing the knowledge we have gained from our own experiences with others, and we still
            feel immensely grateful when others have helped us to the sole benefit of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            While before those implicit debts were easily repayed with kindness or a gesture of gratitude, the
            inter-personal distance and annonymity makes this very difficult on the Internet.  And while services
            exist to order gifts online or send money virtually, they are very involved and borderline impossible
            to set up safely between individuals that have only just met.
        </p>
        <p>
            Really eager people may enquire for the PayPal email address or home address of the person that helped
            them out, but most people, while very willing to send thanks, will not be willing to cross that border.
            In fact, <strong>most recipients would feel uncomfortable sharing such details</strong> or would avoid
            appearing too eager to receive monetary recompense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Send Tnks! is an innitiative to improve this situation.  When giving thanks to someone, we prefer to do
            so with concrete gifts rather than the very impersonal gift of currency.  Send Tnks! makes abstraction
            of currency and allows individuals to thank others for services without the other's involvement, and by
            simply sending a popular token of appriciation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Send Tnks! takes care of delivering your gift to the right individual.  The result is a very simple
            and fast way for sending someone a real token of appreciation.
